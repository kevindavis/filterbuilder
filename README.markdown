## What is this thing?

Filter Builder is some javascript UI for building up a filter in a data driven application. You've used something similar if you've built a smart playlist in iTunes.

## How do I use it?

check out the example

## What can this thing filter?

Erm.. nothing really. It's a UI only component.

## Are there any dependencies?

This is built using:

* backbone.js
* backbone-localStorage
* bootstrap

## Can I help?

Of course! I rebuilt an earlier version of this so I could check out bootstrap. Would be thrilled if anyone bothered to even check this out.
