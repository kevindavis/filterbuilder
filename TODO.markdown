## UX tweaks 
* shouldn't be able to remove the last clause (hide with CSS :first?)
* style for same sized dropdowns
* nicer looking remove

## Bigger issues
* should build clauses up from JSON representation
* should actually spit out a JSON representation
* rework data structure so don't have to loop through to find elements (comparator as key in the hash?)
* any/all switch? 
* allow user to refer to fields?
* package as a JQuery plugin
* mechanism for attaching a function to arguments so you can do things like make it an autocomplete, date picker etc
